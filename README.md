# SwiftAlgorithms

Using Swift 2.0

Resolution to some of the most common algorithms, problems and challenges using Swift.

I just created a single-view application and I'm going to create the functions on the ViewController.swift file. While these might not be the best solutions to these common problems, I'm more than happy to have your collaboration, discussion or sugestions.

List of Algorithms (so far):

- Simple word count;
- Check if a string is a palindrome;
- FizzBuzz
